        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I've always been obsessed with technology. Since the early days I've been blown away 
           by the things that people have done with an innovative mindset and knowledge in their field.
           My goal as a newcomer to the software world is to pursue and generate avenues for innovation
           in everyday life via tech.
        </p>
        <p>When I'm not working on software or playing with various technologies, I'm likely out skating or playing games. 
           I play tons of rocket league and probably spend too much time on it, but everyone needs a break here and there.
        </p>
