        <h2>Welcome to my demo site!</h2>
        <p>I'm currently studying Software engineering at flatiron school out of Denver, Colorado. I'm thrilled to have this opportunity and can't wait to see what kind of things myself and the other students in my cohort are able to accomplish!</p>

            <p>I'm Garret Gallant, an amateur software engineer working to grow my skills as a developer through Flatiron School! Right now I specialize in nothing, but I have a feeling in the next few month's that will change.</p>

            <h3>About</h3>
                <p>I've always been obsessed with technology. From the age of 11 on, I was always blown away 
                by the things that people have done with an innovative mindset and knowledge in their field.
                My goal as a newcomer to the software world is to pursue and generate avenues for innovation
                in everyday life via tech.</p>
