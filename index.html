            <p>I'm Garret Gallant, an amateur software engineer working to grow my skills as a developer through Flatiron School! Right now I specialize in nothing, but I have a feeling in the next few month's that will change.</p>

            <p>Nothing custom built yet, but I have quite a few projects showing off some skills over at  <a href="https://github.com/Garret-Gallant">Github</a> </p>

            <h3>About</h3>
                <p>I've always been obsessed with technology. From the age of 11 on, I was always blown away 
                by the things that people have done with an innovative mindset and knowledge in their field.
                My goal as a newcomer to the software world is to pursue and generate avenues for innovation
                in everyday life via tech.</p>
